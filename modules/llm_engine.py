Company Name: {company_name}
Website: {website}{context_block}

Perform a comprehensive investigation and return a rich JSON object. 
Instead of strict fields, write a massive, incredibly detailed 2000-15000 word markdown report in the "full_markdown_report" field. This report should contain the ENTIRE analysis, exactly as you would output it directly in ChatGPT (using headings, bold text, bullet points, and tables if necessary).

Cover absolutely everything in extreme detail:
1. Executive Summary & Core Value Proposition
2. Comprehensive Product/Service Portfolio Breakdown: Analyze ALL services offered on their website in detail.
3. Marketing & Lead Generation: Take a deep look at their marketing strategies, how they are generating leads, and their digital footprint.
4. Business & Financials: Provide estimates or insights on their revenue, business size, and scale based on available data.
5. Detailed Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) with specific pains, deep desires, and perfectly crafted hooks
6. Complete Competitive Landscape (who are their top 3-5 competitors, what are they doing better, where is this company weak)
7. Sales & GTM Strategy: What channels should they use? What are the quick wins?
8. Common Objections & Rebuttals (What will prospects say to say no, and how to counter it)
9. Cold Email Angles (Provide 3 distinct cold email angles/hooks for outreach)
10. SEO & Digital Presence analysis (What is missing? SERP Hawk opportunities)

- Aggressively fix speech-to-text errors (e.g., "varsit adre gmail dot com" -> "varsitadre@gmail.com").
- For pure conversation (greetings, questions about CRM status, thank-yous) — respond naturally without calling any tool. Keep it brief.
- Never say "I cannot" or "I don't have access to". Just do it.
